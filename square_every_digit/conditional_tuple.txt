multiplier *= (10, 100)[digit > 3]

A conditional tuple in Python is not a standard term but refers to a technique where 
a tuple is used in conjunction with an indexing operation to simulate a conditional
statement.
  
This technique leverages the fact that boolean values True and False can be used as indices in a tuple,
 where False is equivalent to 0 and True is equivalent to 1.
